# ACCESS-NRI discourse theme

## Installation

### CodeBlock theme component

Due to the way this component is wired up, it will require a small change to one of your site settings.

 1. head to your.site.com/admin/site\_settings/
 2. search for theme\_authorized\_extensions
 3. add css to that list.

Like so:

add css to theme authorized extensions

You have to do this before you install the component, otherwise it wonâ€™t work.
